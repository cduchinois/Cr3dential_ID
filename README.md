# Cr3dntial

Cr3dntial is a DID (Decentralized Identifier) based dApp that allows users to store their credentials on the XRPL testnet mainchain.
We've built the Dapp during a previous hackathon.
During the EasyA x Ripple x Apex Hackathon we've been enabled Zero-Knowledge Proof and verification as well as a Cr3dential experience under 36 hours!
